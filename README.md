# aegisub_macros
Useful scripts for exporting and formatting subtitles.

### webvtt.exporter
Simple repackaging of Aegisub lines to basic WebVTT format subtitles.

### wrap_text.lua
Wraps text by inserting linebreak (\N) at some defined line length. Aegisub has its own wrapping engine (accessed from Script Properties), but this wrapping isn't applied to exported file formats such as SRT.
